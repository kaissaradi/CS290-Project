                <p> This page was created as a resource hub for its owner. After getting tired of constantly checking the same few websites for information before heading up to the mountain, I decided it would be most useful for me to use this project to
                    create one centeral webpage where I can find the information i need at any given time. </p>

                <h4>History and Background</h4>
                <p>From Wikipedia:</p>
                <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Hood">Mount Hood, called Wy'east by the Multnomah tribe, is a potentially active stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc. It was formed by a subduction zone on the Pacific coast and rests in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States.
                    It is located about 50 miles (80 km) east-southeast of Portland, on the border between Clackamas and Hood River counties. In addition to being Oregon's highest mountain, it is one of the loftiest mountains in the nation based on its
                    prominence, and it offers the only year-round lift-served skiing in North America.
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Hood">
                    Timberline Lodge is a National Historic Landmark located on the southern flank of Mount Hood just below Palmer Glacier, with an elevation of about 6,000 feet (1,800 m). The mountain has six ski areas: Timberline, Mount Hood Meadows, Ski Bowl, Cooper Spur,
                    Snow Bunny, and Summit. They total over 4,600 acres (7.2 sq mi; 19 km2) of skiable terrain; Timberline, with one lift having a base at nearly 6,940 ft (2,120 m), offers the only year-round lift-served skiing in North America.
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Hood">The Multnomah name for Mount Hood was Wy'east. In one version of the legend, the two sons of the Great Spirit Sahale fell in love with the beautiful maiden Loowit, who could not decide which to choose. The two braves, Wy'east and Pahto,
                    burned forests and villages in their battle over her. Sahale became enraged and smote the three lovers. Seeing what he had done, he erected three mountain peaks to mark where each fell. He made beautiful Mount St. Helens for Loowit,
                    proud and erect Mount Hood for Wy'east, and the somber Mount Adams for the mourning Pahto. There are other versions of the legend. In another telling, Wy'east (Hood) battles Pahto (Adams) for the fair La-wa-la-clough (St. Helens).
                    Or again Wy'east, the chief of the Multnomah tribe, competed with the chief of the Klickitat tribe. Their great anger led to their transformation into volcanoes. Their battle is said to have destroyed the Bridge of the Gods and thus
                    created the great Cascades Rapids of the Columbia River.</blockquote>
