# CS290 Course Project
In this project, you need to use HTML/CSS and JavaScript to build a simple website and publish it online. You can build a personal website for yourself, or a website of a small business or organization like a farm, a restaurant, a park, a hotel, a baseball club, or a website of some tutorials, showing skills that you have expertise in and want to share with others. You have a lot of freedom to determine the details of your website as long as you meet the requirements.  The theme doesnâ€™t need to be real. Be creative! You will have three weeks (w6-w8) to work on this project.
