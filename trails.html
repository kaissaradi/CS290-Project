                <h4 id="list-item-1">Burnt Lake     Out and Back</h4>
                <p>From OregonHikers:
                    <blockquote cite="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Burnt_Lake_Hike">Burnt Lake is named after a 1904 forest fire. An even larger blaze, accidentally started by a local homesteader in 1906, scorched a wider area around the lake. In those days, the forest understory was more open, but most of the big trees remaining were killed by the 1906 fire.

                        The Burnt Lake Trail #772 begins wide and gentle on an old road track in a lush forest that was burned over in the late 19th century. Start to the right of the trail sign, where you pass through a stile. The principal tree cover here is Douglas-fir, western hemlock, silver fir and vine maple. Review the map board and sign in at the wilderness permit box. Burnt Lake Creek runs down to the right and is shaded by red-cedar. Large, scorched stumps, mainly cedars, are all that remain of the magnificent old-growth forest. Lady fern, devil's club, sword fern, starry solomon plume, oxalis, and bunchberry form a lush groundcover. Gradually ascend. A spur to the right leads down to a tributary of Burnt Lake Creek. Cross the creek after this and round another large cedar snag. Then, cross several small creeks using plank walks. Another spur to the left leads down into the Lost Creek valley for views from the top of multi-tiered Lost Creek Falls and a campsite. To get a head-on view of the falls requires more of a scramble and bushwhack to the creek bed.
                        
                        The trail switchbacks up from here and makes a traverse, crossing a creek and then becomes a long gradual ascent. Brooklets gush from springs above the trail. The path dips to cross a creek reeking of skunk-cabbage. The trail crosses a plank bridge and enters a Sitka alder clearing. Cross Burnt Lake Creek and head up to Burnt Lake, keeping right. At a spot marked B, No Camping Here, one can go left to the shore and get a classic view of Mount Hood reflected in the still waters. The montane forest encircling the lake is composed of silver fir, cedar, hemlock, Sitka alder and mountain ash. The trail heads up to a junction with the circular path around the lake. You can take this path, which is very brushy in spots, around Burnt Lake to reach other designated campsites. There are at least five small tarns in the vicinity of the lake: the largest, reached by a short, brushy bushwhack, are at the foot of a talus slope just southeast of the lake.
                        
                        Many day hikers, and most of those camping overnight here, will continue to the viewpoint on East Zigzag Mountain (See the East Zigzag from Lost Creek Hike). Be cautioned, however, that early in the season, when the slopes are still snow-covered, it is very easy to go off track on the way back down from East Zigzag Mountain and find yourself plunging into the trailless drainage of the West Fork of Burnt Lake Creek.</blockquote>

                        Continuing on the Burnt Lake Trail, pass a campsite and then a small tarn on the left. The trail drops to cross Burnt Lake Creek and reaches the bottom of a slope. You'll traverse up to the left and then make a couple of switchbacks. Hike through dark woods and cross an open wet meadow before traversing up to the right. The trail switchbacks under mountain hemlock, noble fir, and lodgepole pine. A spur leads right to a view of Mount Hood. Then you'll make four more switchbacks and come to the signposted junction with the Zigzag Mountain Trail #775 at mile 4.2.
                        
                        Head right here and rise steeply to a viewpoint of Burnt Lake and Mount Hood. The trail levels and you get great views of Mount Adams, Mount Rainier, and Mount Saint Helens. At the Zigzag Mountain-Burnt Lake Trail West Junction, keep straight for East Zigzag Mountain. The loose tread heads steeply up, and at a junction near the top, bear right. This takes you to the rocky summit. To the south, you can now see Olallie Butte and Mount Jefferson. Also visible are Multorpor Mountain, Ski Bowl, and Tom Dick and Harry Mountain. Noble fir, mountain hemlock, lodgepole pine, boxwood, bear-grass and huckleberry cloak the summit. Look for beautiful bear grass displays in June, particularly on the east slope. There is a possible camp spot just to the west where there used to be a fire lookout.
                        
                        To finish the hike, go back to the trailhead the way you came.</blockquote>

                <p>From OregonHikers:
                    <blockquote cite="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Castle_Canyon_Hike">Walk 15 yards down the road from the pullout to take up the Castle Canyon Trail #765. Head into Douglas-fir, cedar, hemlock woods, with an Oregon grape, oxalis, salal and sword fern carpet. Cross an old road bed and a local trail. Reach the wilderness permit box, where vine maples, alders, and big-leaf maples form a leafy canopy. The trail winds up to a junction with another local trail leading off to the right. Pass an old Motor Vehicles Prohibited sign on a tree. Large stumps in the woods attest to the primeval forest that once was. The trail heads to the right and rises more steeply in a series of seven short switchbacks. After this, pass a small clearing and head up along the rocky spine of the ridge. There are gullies to the left and right. The spine steepens and the trail drops to the right. Ascend to the right of a rocky palisade on a rooty trail. These rocks are composed of fused pyroclastic material, or volcanic breccia. The trail reaches the higher outcropping and heads up below it. There’s a fantastic rampart up to the right as well. Rise to the left past an old Trail Not Maintained sign and switchback up to the top of a craggy palisade. Below this point, the Pinnacles Viewpoint, spurs lend easier access to the spine of this outcrop, with views across the Zigzag Valley to Hunchback Mountain. It is a temptation for many visitors to scramble about on the formations, but take care, especially on wet days, and wear proper footware.</blockquote>

                <h4 id="list-item-4">Zigzag Mountain   Loop</h4>
                <p>From OregonHikers:
                    <blockquote cite="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Zigzag_Mountain_Loop_Hike">A stunning high ridge loop with frequent views of Mount Hood and other Cascade peaks begins at the South Burnt Lake Trailhead, the least enjoyable part of this excursion being the slow, potholed trundle to the parking area via Enola Hill (Enola, though sounding musically exotic, is merely 'alone' spelled backwards). On this tour of Zigzag Mountain's finest features, you'll encounter lush wet meadows and blooming dry meadows, two former lookout sites, a secluded mountain lake, and vistas from Mount Rainier to Mount Jefferson, with nearby Mount Hood always dominating the scenery. Mid-summer is the best time - make sure you start early to get the best out of the sights along the way!

                        The Burnt Lake Trail #772 heads up an old road bed in woods of western hemlock, cedar, alder, silver fir, Douglas-fir, rhododendron, salal, and vine maple. Henry Creek rushes down to your left. Soon, reach the the wilderness permit box. You'll step over a small creek, and then cross a larger stream over a culvert. The road bed enters a lush bracken, mertensia, and thimbleberry clearing rimmed with Sitka alder and willow. Finally, the road ends at the site of the abandoned Devils Meadow Campground. A spur leads down to the right towards the meadow, but the tread is lost among the thick growth of willow and alder thickets. The path rises, and noble fir enters the forest mix. Cross a trickling brook in an alder thicket, and get a view down to the right to the expanse of Devils Meadow. Mosquitoes breed in their masses here in early summer. The trail passes through a lush meadow and then levels and drops through more mountain meadows. When you come to the Burnt Lake-Devils Tie Trail Junction, keep straight.
                        
                        Cross a creek, and switchback up among lodgepole pine, bear-grass, huckleberry, and rhododendron. Note also some western white pine and mountain hemlock. The trail levels to cross a small creek before you head up in silver fir woods. Three switchbacks take you to a lush meadow riddled with mountain beaver burrows. Then the path switchbacks to a veritable rock garden of larkspur, paintbrush, phlox, and serviceberry. You'll pass through a bear-grass meadow, followed by another dry meadow with views across to Devils Peak. The trail loops up to the ridge crest and junction with the Zigzag Mountain Trail. There’s a magnificent view of Mount Hood looming large to the east, and vistas extend north to the Washington Cascades.
                        
                        Go left at the junction in a bear-grass meadow, and head along the crest to begin the ascent of East Zigzag Mountain. Take in views of Burnt Lake below and back to Tom Dick and Harry Mountain, Olallie Butte and Mount Jefferson. At a junction, keep right for the summit spur. Wildflowers bloom in profusion here. On the rocky summit, the views are expansive. Over the summit, the path rejoins the main trail, where you'll keep right, passing a campsite. The trail descends the ridge crest in a brilliant paintbrush meadow with mountain sandwort, sulfur buckwheat and mariposa adding color. The path reenters montane woods and winds down steeply to the Zigzag Mountain-Cast Creek Trail Junction. Keep left, and drop to a level area wooded with lodgepole pines. Here, you'll find the junction with the Cast Lake Trail #796, where you can make a right to visit the lake.
                        
                        The Cast Lake Trail rises to a saddle and then drops. The tread levels in a wet meadow with willow, shooting stars and buttercups. Then the path makes a final short drop to the marshy shore of Cast Lake. Marsh marigolds, shooting stars and violets bloom here in the summer. A small creek enters the lake, and there are surprisingly few mosquitoes compared to Devils Meadow.
                        
                        After you return to the Zigzag Mountain Trail, go right to pass through a level meadow dotted with lodgepole pines. Soon pass the junction with the Devils Tie Trail, which heads down to the left. The Zigzag Mountain Trail rises under silver fir, noble fir, red-cedar, and mountain hemlock among stretches of bear-grass. Then the path winds up more steeply, make a rising traverse to level at a glade of Sitka alder and blooming avalanche lilies. From this spot, you'll get a view of the Washington peaks and Dumbbell Lake nestled below, with Mount Hood rising massively on the right. The trail then drops along a wooded ridge to a bear-grass saddle. It rises below a rocky outcrop with another great view of Mount Hood. The path winds up and traverses the north slope of Zigzag Mountain. A short off-trail hike leads to the summit of Zigzag Mountain, where you'll get views extending from Mount Jefferson to the Washington peaks. From here, the trail descends bear-grass meadows to the junction with the Horseshoe Ridge Trail #774. Stay left here to continue hiking among bear-grass and rhododendrons. After passing another rocky outcrop, the trail undulates along the ridge crest and then winds down more steeply. Then there's a rising traverse before the trail levels to cross a small brook. From here, the tread rises more steeply to the ridge crest before proceeding up and down to reach the junction with the West Zigzag Mountain Trail #789.
                        
                        From the junction, keep straight to make the short detour to a clifftop viewpoint. The trail rises gently to the site of the old West Zigzag Lookout. These days, four concrete foundation posts and a few rusted nails remain in a grove of young lodgepole pines. The view is splendid across the Zigzag River Valley down to Flag Mountain and across to Devils Peak, with Mount Jefferson’s jagged summit visible on the horizon. After taking in these views, return to the junction with the West Zigzag Mountain Trail, which heads down to the right.
                        
                        This trail, although not well-traveled, is usually easy to follow. There’s a long traverse down among rhododendron, bear-grass, Douglas-fir, cedar and silver fir. You'll cross a small boulder field and then a tributary of Henry Creek. The trail rises in a long traverse and then drops over a ridge. The path switchbacks and traverses downward, becoming quite steep in places. Cross Henry Creek, and then rise past a wilderness permit box to reach FR 27. Walk to the left about 80 yards to reach the parking area and your vehicle.

                <h4 id="list-item-5">Still Creek   Out and Back</h4>
                <p>From OregonHikers:
                    <blockquote cite="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Still_Creek_Hike">From the parking area in the Camp Creek Campground, cross the footbridge over Camp Creek and bear left. Follow the trail along the south bank of Camp Creek before rising up a mossy slope. Keep right at a junction and pass a spring. Wind up through a sword fern carpet under larger trees and old snags to reach Road 32.

                        Cross the road and resume the trail, passing a signpost. Rise gradually and detour around a spring on the trail itself. These are moss-carpeted Douglas-fir/hemlock woods with a groundcover of Oregon grape and salal. At a shallow crest, cross an old road bed and gently descend to pass over a series of footbridges in an area of gushing springs. Make a gradually rising traverse in dense secondary forest, and then traverse a slope, actually the western foot of Tom Dick and Harry Mountain, under larger trees. Now you will hear, but not see, Still Creek rushing below. The traverse undulates a little and then drops in mossy woods to FR 2612 (Still Creek Road).
                        
                        Cross the road and pass a berm to drop down a rubbly track to the former campsite at Still Creek: camping is now forbidden here as restoration of the area is underway. Cabled logs line the creek bank to protect the shoreline, and the space is dominated by a towering Douglas-fir guarded by a couple of impressive cedars.

                <h4 id="list-item-6">Salmon River   Out to Loop and Back</h4>
                <p>From OregonHikers:
                    <blockquote cite="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Salmon_River_Hike">From the trailhead, climb steeply at first, then traverse above the river briefly before passing above a huge island along a rocky ledge. The island is a wide peninsula cut off from the shore by a small, meandering fork that splits from the main river. The massive trees on the island are a preview of the old growth ahead along the main trail. Soon you will reach the point where the fork splits from the main river. Notice how easily the river could rearrange a few logs and send the main branch of the river through the smaller fork! This is a fine example of how stream channels can abruptly change over time.

                        The trail passes a deep eddy along a rock cliff, then plunges into extremely lush old growth forest, briefly pulling away from the river. Many unmarked side trails drop to the right, usually marking favorite fishing spots. In April, this first mile of trail is lined with formal white trillium and showy groups of fawn lily.
                        
                        At the 1.5 mile mark, begin to pass periodic campsites, including one that used to be formally known as Bighorn Campground. A footbridge once crossed the Salmon here, leading to the Hambone Trail on the opposite shore. After another half mile, reach the Rolling Riffle Campground, another longtime camp spot, where one site still retains a decaying picnic table. Signs mark this campground, and this is a reasonable spot to complete if you don’t want to tackle the climb to the viewpoint. These campsite are usually full on weekends, so if you plan to spend the night, arrive early.
                        
                        From Rolling Riffle, the trail crosses a side stream on a bridge, then reaches the wilderness boundary, and registration box. From here, the trail begins climbing away from the river, curving in and out of three side canyons with small streams before reaching a high bluff. At an unmarked fork, take the trail on the right, which quickly leads to a rocky viewpoint of the canyon, and a small waterfall on the river, some 600 feet below. This is a good spot to stop for lunch, and soak in the view. A scramble path drops below the trail here, but resist the temptation to follow it: the views are no better, and these are dangerous cliffs that have been fatal to several careless hikers.
                        
                        From the viewpoint, the narrow path curves across a steep, exposed slope before entering woods, and climbing through two switchbacks to the main trial. You can continue upstream here for another mile to campsites and water at Goat Creek. But if you are day hiking, you’ve already had the best views (that can be reached safely), so turn left and follow the main trail back to the trailhead. A safer way to see the waterfalls is to visit the links below, where you can view photos from trips to the bottom of the gorge by foot and by kayak.</blockquote>

                <p>From OregonHikers:
                    <blockquote cite="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Tom_Dick_and_Harry_Mountain_Hike">From the plaza at the parking area, find the paved ADA trail that leads down a slope behind the restrooms. Six winding switchbacks descend to a wide footbridge over Camp Creek, where the paved section ends. You're in a secondary forest of Douglas-fir, western hemlock, silver fir, noble fir, and western red-cedar. Before Camp Creek, a pole-and-rail barrier prevents shortcutting at a switchback.

                        After Camp Creek, you're on a wide machine-built trail. Cross two footbridges over seasonally dry gullies. The next bridge crosses the creek that drains the Comerford Lakes. Rise gradually to cross more footbridges over trickling creeks that feed small bogs below. Rhododendrons enter the understory, and you'll see springboard notches on rotting stumps. The trail undulates along, passing over more bridges, and soon crosses Mirror Lake Creek. Cross an old logging road, and then bend sharp left to rise steeply and intersect the old tread which came up from the U.S. 26 trailhead. Whole trees have been felled over this path to decommission it.
                        
                        Switchback on the narrower old tread, and pass a vine maple-verged patch of talus. Walk on another old logging road for a few yards, pass through a devil's club thicket, and switchback up twice to where a new pole-and-rail fence prevents cutting corners. Reach the Mirror Lake-Mirror Lake Shore Trail North Junction, and go left to begin your clockwise tour around Mirror Lake.
                        
                        Cross a single log footbridge over Mirror Lake Creek, and then emerge from the woods at an open bracken slope above Mirror Lake itself. Pass through a thicket of Sitka alder, ocean spray, and boxwood to get views up to the crags of Tom Dick and Harry Mountain. There are various short spurs that access the lake shore. Washington lilies and penstemon bloom alongside the path in summer. On the south shore, you'll see a set of steps leading down. Silver fir, Alaska yellow-cedar, and western red-cedar shade a well-trodden flat here. Cross a rocky stream bed, and see where a trail leads down to the shore for the iconic views you see in many photographs. The reflection of Mount Hood is perfect on a still day without a whisper of a breeze. When it's windy, expect a more Impressionist effect. The Shore Trail continues around to a two-plank boardwalk through a spiraea/willow swamp, where you'll get more views of Mount Hood. When you reach the Mirror Lake-Mirror Lake Shore Trail South Junction, make a sharp left to begin the ascent to Tom Dick and Harry Mountain.
                        
                        The route continues through handsome forest, thick with pink rhododendrons in early summer, before reaching the steep north slopes of Tom Dick and Harry Mountain. This section of trail is lush with wildflowers in summer, and features unusual views of Highway 26 far below, as well as Mount Hood and the Zigzag Mountain high country. The trail continues along this slope, gradually climbing to a broad crest, where a huge rock cairn at 3.3 miles marks a switchback toward the summit. From the cairn, continue at an easy grade along the ridgetop through open lodgepole forest for a half-mile before reaching a steep, more rocky section of trail as you near the west or Harry summit of Tom Dick and Harry Mountain.
                        
                        The final pitch is up an open rocky crest, where the view is dominated by Mount Hood and Mirror Lake nestled in its forested bowl below. On the northern skyline, Mount Saint Helens, Mount Rainier, and Mount Adams can be seen on a clear day. The view also includes Mount Jefferson to the south and the high, wild ridge tops of the Salmon-Huckleberry Wilderness to the southwest. The village of Government Camp and Timberline Lodge are also visible from this airy perch. Golden-mantled ground squirrels and pikas scuttle about on the slopes of platy andesite.
                        
                        Making a loop:
                        
                        A rough trail leads along the ridge through lodgepole pines and blooming lupine and lousewort. You'll pass the craggy buttress of Dick and then reach the summit of Tom Peak in a cross-country ski corridor known as Treviso's Traverse. Get views to the Comerford Lakes below, and pass interpretive signs on the local wildlife and vegetation. Join Skyline Road near Skibowl Peak and the top of the Upper Sky Chair. Descending the road, pass the Skyline Road-Wind Lake Trail Junction (See the Wind Lake-Multorpor Fen Loop Hike.). Here you can make a side trip to Wind Lake, about half a mile away. You can use roads to get back through the Ski Bowl West area to the Mirror Lake Trailhead. Do NOT hike down Ski Bowl's mountain bike trails!</blockquote>
